# tune-pauser
A WebExtension that pauses background audio when new audio starts playing.

Developed for Firefox (probably compatible with Chrome and maybe Edge). Intended for cases when background music is playing (such as a soundtrack on youtube) and you want to watch a seperate video in another tab. Rather than switching tabs, pausing the music, switching back, and restarting the music afterwards, this extension aims to automate the process.
