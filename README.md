# tune-pauser
A WebExtension that pauses background audio when new audio starts playing.

Developed for Firefox (probably compatible with Chrome and maybe Edge). Intended for cases when background music is playing (such as a soundtrack on youtube) and you want to watch a seperate video in another tab. Rather than switching tabs, pausing the music, switching back, and restarting the music afterwards, this extension aims to automate the process.

EDIT: It turns out that there is a very simple way to mute tabs that I have just become aware of (clicking on the sound icon). Regardless, I'm still going to try to develop this extension as a learning exercise. There may yet be a way to actually pause the audio in question instead of just muting it as well.
